# UWB-Localisation

The goal of the course was to come with an approach to synchronise the communication between more IoT boards in order to build an indoor and outdoor localisation system.
During the course we have tackled low level programming in C and developed a system that allows to access all the funcionality over a web browser.

In the final assignment we went further and built an UWB based localisation system. 

The in this way collected data we then presented in form of an django web application.
